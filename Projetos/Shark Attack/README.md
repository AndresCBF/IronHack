# Shark Attack Project 

This project have as objective: 
1. Clean up  data to make it usful 
2. Find usefull information whitin the clean data 
3. Answer the question: The deadly rate of shark attacks is increasing?

## Clean up 
The data set have several issues, the bigger issue was 65 % of the Rows are fill with NANs or missing information, reviewing the information clean the obsolete data, emapty columns and rows with more that have  20% of the information as NANs. 

The second bigger issue is the quality of the information  in the Columns, as example the columns "age"and "year" have some information as text other as numeric, and other as alphanumeric and NANs, treated the information to get only numerical data and NANs, the NANs where treat creating a new column with a range, get this as "unknown". 

Other columns have similar issue with upper, lower letters, special characters, creatinf duplicated information or invalid information, after treating this, we get valiuble information i all our Data sets    


## Data Analyze 



## Conclutions  

The USA have the higher ammount of shark attacks reports, we use  the use to analyze and determinate if the rate of fatal attacks is incresing or decresing

We concluded that the faltal attacks are decressing during the time in the USA

We have an increase of reports during the decades of 1950s, and the number of fatal attacks do not increasse as the number of reports

We can conclued that the numer of reports during times are incressing, and the numeber of fatal attacks during the time continue stable, so  the persantage of fatal attacks is decressing during the time 

## Next steps 
1. Determine the location in USA where have more attacks and if this location are in the migration path of the sharks 
2. Determine the dates of the attacks and if this dates correspondes to the migration dates
